<ol>
  <li>The best location that guarantees patronage and profits;</li>
  <li>An insight into the best months in terms of revenue;</li>
  <li>To have an idea of the average price for rents based on the numbers of rooms in an accommodation;</li>
  <li>To have an idea about the cleaning costs;</li>
  <li>Confirm the type of accommodation that is in high demand;</li>
  <li>To have an idea into the various types of accommodations already listed.</li>
</ol>
