<h3>Business Task</h3> 
<p>Airbnb is an online marketplace based in San Francisco, U.S that connects people who wants to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in specific locations.</p>
<p>A potential client wants to list his property with Airbnb and therefore wants the best deals. He wants:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The best location that guarantees patronage and profits;</li>
  <li>An insight into the best months in terms of revenue;</li>
  <li>To have an idea of the average price for rents based on the numbers of rooms in an accommodation;</li>
  <li>To have an idea about the cleaning costs;</li>
  <li>Confirm the type of accommodation that is in high demand;</li>
  <li>To have an idea into the various types of accommodations already listed.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Data Sources</h3> 
<p>There are three tables:<p>
<ol>
